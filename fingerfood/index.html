    <h1>Finger Food Design Challenge</h1>
			
    <h2><span class="num-count">01 /</span> Sketch Sketch Sketch</h2>
    <p>I always start any design project with my sketchbook. It gets ideas&mdash; both good and bad&mdash;out quickly, keeping me from  solving the visual part of the problem before I'm ready. Sketches help me explore visual heirarchy and flow, and they're a critical step in my problem solving. I work through a lot of potential pitfalls as I draw, and I start developing a visual picture of how I want the product to start to feel.</p>

    <h2><span class="num-count">02 /</span> To the Machine</h2>
		<p>After I've sketched both good and bad ideas, I review my work and choose the strongest options to continue to build out. I move to the computer and begin layout design. I think through spacing between components, colors, typography and navigation. I use placeholders for icons and images until I'm happy with the basic layout I have. I normally have a good mental picture of color schemes and visual feel before I move to the computer, but I do a lot of exploration and refinement as I build it out.</p>

    <p>I like to use Sketch symbols during this process because it helps me make a lot of explorational changes quickly, but I don't spent a ton of time making sure things are aligned perfectly or named correctly&mdash;I won't use 80% of what I create in this phase anyways. Once I'm happy with what I have, I move on to the next concept. I'll come back to this design later and refine further, but I don't want to get too attached to any one design at this stage.</p>
			
    <h2><span class="num-count">03 /</span> Wash, Rinse, Repeat</h2>
    <p>After I've explored one design direction, I go back to my sketches and choose another option I'd like to explore. From there I repeat the same process. Depending on the project this could take a few hours or a few weeks. I try to stretch the creative bounds of the project, thinking of as many different ways to solve the problem as I can.</p>

		<p>In the example above I wanted the "scenes" (Everything's On, Everything Off, etc) to feel more special&mdash;I wanted the visual heirarchy to feel less like a list and more important. I explored a full-screen view for each "scene", with the ability to swipe between each scene. A simple line illustration for each scene adds to the visual interest and helps users have a visual reference as to where they are.</p>

		<h2><span class="num-count">04 /</span> Refining &amp; Perfecting</h2>
		<p>Once I've finished the exploration phase, I return to the concepts I feel are strongest and start to refine them. I sketch out the iconography I want, find images, and start fine-tuning typography. This is also where I start animating things&mdash;tap states, transition states, iconography, or anything else that might need animating.</p>

    <h1><span class="num-count" style="vertical-align: 15%;">05 /</span> The First Solution</h1>
		<p>Sometimes I'll offer more than one design solution during the early parts of a project, especially if the particular client doesn't have strong brand guidelines or was vague about the design requirements. Since I didn't have any brand guidelines for this exercise, I took some liberties about the brand.</p>
		<p>My first solution stays fairly true to the wireframes provided. It fixes some of the smaller UX painpoints but is still a vertical list of options that you can edit. </p>

    <p>I wanted this portion of the app to feel simple, quick to learn and easy to master. The color palette is simple, and the dark background helps the selected &ldquo;scene&rdquo; stand out. Since the visual language of the app is so simple, I wanted the iconography to have a bit more complexity. I kept the typography clean and simple throughout&amp;since this portion of the app is about quickly editing, I didn't feel expressive typography was appropriate.</p>

		<p>As I mentioned previously, this solution brings more expression into the &ldquo;scene&rdquo; selector view. A simple line illustration fills with color when the scene is selected, making it clear that it is active. The edit function is downplayed but still readily accesible.</p>

		<p class="unbold">Oh, and if you'd like the Sketch files I can send them, but please keep in mind I had speed in mind when designing this exercise. My use of symbols, text styles and layer styles are lacking, because the focus of my time was on quick exploration.)</p>
