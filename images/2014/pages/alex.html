    <p>As you can tell from the pictures, Alex spends a lot of time with Brecken.  She stayed home the past year and has had a ton of fun making mom/baby friends in local mom groups-so much so that she now runs one group and co-runs another!  Daily adventures, mom's nights out, and book clubs keep Alex plenty busy, but she is also applying to take the Colorado Bar Exam in February with hopes of returning to criminal law in the near future.  Despite all that, Alex is determined to bring her snowboards out of retirement and ride some Colorado snow this season.</p>
