        <h1>Safewatch</h1>
        <h2>Safewatch was a software product that was intended to keep track of medications and dispense them when appropriateâ€”but not before. The concept was amazing, as was the team, but unfortunately funding was never secured and the project never got off the ground.</h2>

				<h2>I always start my design process on pen &amp; paper. You can see the influence it had on the final product. Simplicity was key for the Safewatch experience &amp; a lot of the target users were older, forgetful, and not very tech-savvy.</h2>
