        <h1>Chipotle Mobile App</h1>
        <h2>With millions of downloads on both iOS and Android, it's safe to say the Chipotle mobile app is the most widely used design I've ever had out in the wild. I art directed the project and led the visual design effort for both iOS and Android. The project was met with an overwhelmingly positive response both from the Chipotle team and the public (it won a Webby award and was nominated for another!). The apps are responsible for millions in revenue per month, and both the App Store and Play Store have 4+ star ratings. Download it and play around with it to get the full experience.</h2>
