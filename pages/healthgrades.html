        <h1>Healthgrades</h1>
        <h2>Healthgrades, a healthcare tech company, approached us with the task of bringing their Android app up to par with their iOS experience. My team came back to them with a completely new way of recommending doctors and dentistsâ€”by helping schedule and prepare for your family's wellness, It became an experience that was meant to be interacted with on a daily to weekly basis, instead of in times of need. This project led to Healthgrades changing the core of their end-user experience across all platforms.</h2>
