    <p>Brecken went from a tiny baby to a really busy toddler. She turned one in August and smashed her way through her birthday cake. She has almost all of her teeth and loves showing them off with her grin. She loves all animals, but she adores doggies and kitties the most. Walking is her favorite thing to do&mdash;she would walk to the moon (you know&hellip; if it were possible&hellip; and stuff&hellip;)&mdash;and you can almost always find her under a pile of books. She is a smart, sweet and independent girl who makes us laugh every single day.</p>
