  <main>  
    <p>Brian spends his days designing mobile apps &amp; websites at Deloitte Digital, and spends his nights playing city-league softball, pick-up hockey, and disc golf. He loooves it here (though he wishes there was more snow...). He thinks Brecken is the cutest creature ever, and can't get enough of her. </p>
