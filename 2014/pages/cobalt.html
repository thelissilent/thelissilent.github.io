    <p>Cobalt spends his days chasing bunnies around the cul-de-sac, eating snow, and pulling Brian around on his &ldquo;sled&rdquo;. He's finally getting used to playing second fiddle to Brecken, but still tries his hardest to be noticed. There are a lot of dog parks near us, so he finds plenty of ways to get exercise.</p>
